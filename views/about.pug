    p I started my journey with software in 2018. I started learning mainly for work but bit by bit learning to code has become an essential part of my day. I started wrong, trying to learn a web framework before learning the basics. I eventually figured out that learning to code is a process in which you build layers upon layers, the foundation needs to be sturdy.
    p I graduated at the German University in Cairo, with a bachelorâ€™s degree in networks engineering and technology, and worked for several years at a global network provider before finding my passion.
    p I enjoy learning, and wish to retain the student mindset for as long as I can.
    p I am currently independent, doing contracting, freelancing, and consulting.
